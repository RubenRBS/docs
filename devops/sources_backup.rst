Backup sources
==============

The *backup sources* feature is intended for storing the downloaded recipe sources in a secondary location,
allowing future reproducibility of your builds even in the case where the original download URLs are no longer accessible.

The backup is triggered for the :ref:`download<conan_tools_files_get>` and :ref:`get<conan_tools_files_get>` methods
when a ``sha256`` signature is provided.


Configuration
-------------
This feature is controlled by a few conf items:

* ``core.sources:download_cache``: `(Optional)` Local path to store the sources backup to.
  If not set, the default Conan home cache path will be used.
* ``core.sources:download_urls``: List of URLs that Conan will try to download the sources from,
  1where ``origin`` represents the original URL. ``["origin"]`` by default
  This allows to control the fetch order, either ``["origin", "https://your.backup/remote/"]``
  to look into and fetch from your backup remote only if and when the original source is not present,
  or ``["https://your.backup/remote/", "origin"]`` to prefer your remote ahead of the recipes.
  (*Note that being a list, multiple remotes are also possible!*)
* ``core.sources:upload_url``: `(Optional)` URL of the remote to upload the backups when calling ``conan upload``,
  which might or might not be different from any of the URLs defined for download.
* ``core.sources:exclude_urls``: List of origins to skip backing up.
  If the URL passed to ``get``/``download`` starts with any of the origins included in this list,
  the source won't be uploaded to the backup remote when calling ``conan upload``.


Usage
-----
The usage of this feature can look something like:

- A remote backup repository is set up. This should allow ``POST`` and ``GET`` HTTP methods to modify and fetch its contents.
  An Artifactory generic repository (available in the free Artifactory CE) can be used for this purpose.
  If access credentials are desired, you can use the :ref:`source_credentials.json<reference_config_files_source_credentials>` feature.
- Its URL can then be set in ``core.sources:download_urls`` and ``core.sources:upload_url``.
- In your recipe's ``source()`` method, ensure the relevant ``get``/``download`` calls supply the ``sha256`` signature of the downloaded files.
- Set ``core.sources:download_cache`` in your :ref:`global.conf<reference_config_files_global_conf>` file if a custom location is desired,
  else the default cache folder will be used
- Run Conan normally, creating packages etc.
- Once some sources have been locally downloaded, the path pointed to by ``core.sources:download_cache`` will contain, for each downloaded file:
   - A blob file (no extensions) with the name of the ``sha256`` signature provided in ``get``/``download``.
   - A ``.json`` file which will also have the name of the ``sha256`` signature,
     that will contain information about which references and which mirrors this blob belongs to.
- Calling ``conan upload`` will now optionally upload the backups for the matching references if ``core.sources:upload_url`` is set.
